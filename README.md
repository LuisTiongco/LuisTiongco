## 📝 Git Commands Cheat Sheet 📝

This cheat sheet provides a quick reference to Git commands I use.

1. `git init` - This is the very first step to start tracking changes in your project. It initializes a new and empty Git repository in your local repository. It has **no parameters**, but it is needed to specify which directory to initialize a Git repository first before running **git init**.
    #### Example:
    > cd ~/Repositories/my-awesome-project     
    > git init

<br />

2. `git clone [url]` - If you want to work on an existing remote repository that has Git initialized, use **git clone**. This command **downloads a remote repository to your local machine**. Its parameter needs you to provide the **URL** of the repository you want to clone, and like git init, it is also important to specify which directory you want Git to download the project.
    #### Example:
    > cd ~/Repositories    
    > git clone `https://github.com/LuisTiongco/LuisTiongco.git`

<br />

3. `git add [file]` - After making changes to your files, you need to tell Git which changes you want to track or stage. Use **git add [file]** to add specific files or simply **git add .** to add all modified files in the local repository to the staging area.
    #### Example:
    > git add .

<br />

4. `git commit -m "[description]"` - Once you've added the desired changes to the staging area, use **git commit** to take a **snapshot** of those changes and store them in the **Git history of your local repository**. It is good practice to always provide a clear and concise message describing the changes you've made using the **-m** flag.
    #### Example:
    > git commit -m "Added a new super awesome feature"

<br />

5. `git push [alias] [branch]` - After committing your changes locally, you can use **git push** to push commits to a remote repository. Additionally, you have the option to specify the **remote alias** (often "origin") and the **branch you want to push your changes to** (e.g., "main" or a specific "branch") by establishing an upstream relationship using the **-u** flag. Though not mandatory, this is useful as it allows you to use **git push only** without specifying the remote name and branch in the future.
    #### Example:
    > git push -u origin main

<br />

6. `git status` - To check the current state of your working directory and the staging area. It shows you which files have been **modified**, which are **staged for commit**, and which are **untracked by Git**. It is a local operation to view the status of your local repository and it does **not require any parameters**.
    #### Example:
    > git status

6. `git log` - To view the **commit history** of your repository. This command will display in the terminal, a list of commits in chronological order. For each item in this list, it will contain commit messages, authors, and dates. You can run the command **as it is** to show everything or **put parameters** (e.g., --oneline, --author=[username], --since="[date]") if you have something specific to look for.
    #### Example:
    > git log       
    > git log --since="2023-12-20"
