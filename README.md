## 📝 Git Commands Cheat Sheet 📝

This cheat sheet provides a quick reference to Git commands I use.

1. `git init` - The **git init** command creates a new Git repository. It can be used to convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository.
    #### Example:
    > cd ~/Repositories/MyProject   
    > git init

<br>

2. `git clone [url]` - If a project has already been set up in a central repository, the **git clone** command is the most common way for users to obtain a development copy.
    #### Example:
    > cd ~/Repositories    
    > git clone `https://github.com/LuisTiongco/LuisTiongco.git`

<br>

3. `git add [file]` - The **git add** command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. 
    #### Example:
    > git add .     
    > git hello.py

<br>

4. `git commit -m "[description]"` - The **git commit** command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to.


    #### Example:
    > git commit -m "Added a new feature"

<br>

5. `git push [remote] [branch]` - The **git push** command pushes the specified branch to, along with all of the necessary commits and internal objects. This creates a local branch in the destination repository. To prevent you from overwriting commits, Git won’t let you push when it results in a non-fast-forward merge in the destination repository.
    #### Example:
    > git push -u origin main

<br>

6. `git status` - To check the current state of your working directory and the staging area. It shows you which files have been **modified**, which are **staged for commit**, and which are **untracked by Git**. It is a local operation to view the status of your local repository and it does **not require any parameters**.
    #### Example:
    > git status

<br>

7. `git log` - To view the **commit history** of your repository. This command will display in the terminal, a list of commits in chronological order. For each item in this list, it will contain commit messages, authors, and dates. You can run the command **as it is** to show everything or **put parameters** (e.g., --oneline, --author=[username], --since="[date]") if you have something specific to look for.
    #### Example:
    > git log       
    > git log --since="2023-12-20"
